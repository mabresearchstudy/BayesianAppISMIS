Extended results of the paper "Bayesian Approach for Parameter Estimation in Vehicle Lateral Dynamics" (Fabien Lionti, Nicolas Gutowski, SÃ©bastien Aubin, Philippe Martinet) - Submitted in ISMIS2024

## Figure A - Pairwise plot between each of the parameters to be estimated, visualizing the convergence of samples towards the posterior probability distribution during the iterations of the ABC-SMC algorithm.

## Figure B - Pairwise plot between each of the parameters to be estimated, visualizing the probability density obtained from the \emph{ABC-SMC} algorithm. The density is obtained through kernel density estimation applied to the samples corresponding to the last population of the \emph{ABC-SMC} algorithm.
